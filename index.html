        <h2>Welcome to Thordasha</h2>
        <img src="images/scene1.png" alt="Introduction Image">
    
        
        <p>
            In the world of Thordasha, where malevolence taints the land, Daemon Devilwood, cursed with undeath and wielding the powerful Burning Blade, embarks on a perilous quest for answers. Alongside his loyal ally, Rivek, a skilled warrior, they seek to uncover the source of the corruption that plagues their realm.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their journey leads them to the mysterious necromancer, Valen, who hungers for dark powers to spread the malevolence further. Valen's obsession drives him to an ancient cemetery, where he battles the tormented spirit of the mad lich, Sirion, for the coveted Tome of Shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the tome in hand, Valen performs a summoning ritual, invoking Kurgoroth, the Demon Prince of Undeath. Kurgoroth, a monstrous entity with the head of a warthog, the upper body of a gorilla, and the lower torso of a bird of prey, grants Valen dreadful powers. The necromancer transforms into an undead lich, bound to serve Kurgoroth's malevolent will.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the malevolence spreads, Daemon and Rivek confront Valen in a desperate battle to end his reign of darkness. But the true revelation awaits them as they learn of a forbidden love between Seraphina, a celestial being, and Lahsatyr, who turned malevolent, leading to tragedy and the acquisition of the Scepter of Kings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, Daemon must face his own destiny and resist the malevolence within him, as Seraphina reveals that the sorcerer responsible for her torment is none other than Lahsatyr himself. As the realms collide, Daemon finds himself torn between his determination to save Lahsatyr and the knowledge that redemption might not be possible for one so consumed by evil.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this epic tale of darkness and redemption, Daemon and Rivek embark on a journey that will test their resolve, forge unbreakable bonds, and reveal the true power of their spirits. Will they triumph over the malevolence that threatens to engulf their world, or will they be consumed by the very darkness they seek to vanquish? Only time will tell as they confront the malevolent forces that seek to reshape Thordasha into a realm of eternal darkness.
